Title: Multiselect

----

Excerpt:

A select field that allows you to select multiple options

----

Text:

The multiselect field displays any number of options in a dropdown selectbox with a search box that helps narrowing down the options. This is perfect if you have lots of options, from which the user can just choose one or more.
