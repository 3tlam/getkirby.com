Class: Kirby\Toolkit\A

----
Excerpt:

The A class provides a set of handy methods to simplify array handling and make it more consistent. The class contains methods for fetching elements from arrays, merging and sorting or shuffling arrays.

----
Text:

The methods of the A class are called statically, i.e. without you having to create an object of the class first.

```php
$colors = ['blue', 'yellow', 'green'];

if (A::isAssociative($colors)) {
  return 'Hurray! An associative array';
}
```
