## Details

To have access to the methods of the `$language` object, you need to get a language object first:

### Default language

```php
$language = $kirby->defaultLanguage();
```

### The current language

```php
$language = $kirby->language();
```

### Any particular language

```php
$language = $kirby->language('fr');
```

## Examples

With the object in place, you can use it like this:

### Get the language code

```php
echo $language->code();
```

### Get the language name

```php
echo $language->name();
```

### Get the available translations

```php
dump($language->translations());
```
