## Refunds
You registration is non-refundable once purchased. Cancellations of your travel and/or hotel reservations are your own responsibility. Please notice, that if you can't attend for any reason you are responsible to cancel your room and flights.

## Transferring your Ticket
We know that things can happen, which lead to the fact that you can't attend. As we do not refund any tickets, we give you the opportunity to transfer your ticket to another person. Ticket changes though cost time that we, the closer we get to the event, do not have. Therefore all changes 4 weeks prior an event are free. Changes after that date cost €20 (incl. 19% VAT). However, we are not able to transfer your registration after a certain date. So be sure to let us know as soon as possible if you can't attend. Name changes within 14 days before an event can not be issued.

In summary that means:

- Name changes until **4 weeks before** an event are free
- Name changes **between 4 and 2 weeks before** an event will incur a administration fee of €20 (plus 19% VAT)
- Name changes **within 2 weeks before** an event **can not be made**

## Cancellation

The organisers can change the date of the event or cancel the event due to low numbers of registrations. If the event is cancelled any registered attendee gets back the full entrance fee. Further claims against the organiser are not possible.

## Prices

All prices mentioned on this website are including German VAT of 19%. All conference tickets also include the booking fee. The ticket price for the conference does **not** cover any travel or accommodation.

## Accessibility

Please contact us, if you want to attend at workshops or the conference and have any special requirements such as access for wheelchairs. We will do our very best to accommodate you.

## Photos, Videos and Quotes

We take photos and videos at our events. It may happen that we shoot videos and photos on which you will be included. With your registration you grant us the right to use such material taken over the days. Quotes given on interviews, twitter or on our feedback forms maybe used for future event marketing. Fully credited wherever possible of course. If you don't want a photo on which you are recognizable to be online, please let us know and we take it offline.

If you want to take photos, we are happy that you want to share them with the other attendees and publish them. Let us know where to find them and we gonna tell the other attendees about it. The official hashtag to be used is #kirbykonf. Video and sound recording of any session, talk, presentation or workshop at the whole event is **NOT permitted** unless permission is given by the organiser of the event.
